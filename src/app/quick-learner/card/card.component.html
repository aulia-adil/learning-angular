      <p>In this era, the change is fast and we should be able to adapt
      quickly to this change. In my opinion, if we can learn to do something
      quicker, it will give us better advantages than the rest of our competitor</p>

          How to be a quick learner?

      <p>
        The foremost important idea about being a quick learner is to sleep well.
        Simply because when we sleep, our brain is trying to sink in all the
        information we have gathered of that day.
      </p>
      <p>The next important idea is we have to make a specific goal about what
        we are trying to learn. For example, instead of saying "I want to
        learn coding", we can say "I want to learn how to make a simple calculator
        that is able to do addition and substraction".</p>

      <p>The third important idea is to take a break. After we have spent hours of learning,
        we have to take a break such as taking a nap. This is important because it will
        help us to refresh our mind and be able to learn more.</p>

      <p>The fourth important idea is to teach someone else. This is important because
        when we teach someone else, we will be able to know what we have learned and
        what we have not learned. This will help us to be able to learn more. If we don't
        have anyone to teach, then we can try to make a video of ourselves teaching it.</p>
